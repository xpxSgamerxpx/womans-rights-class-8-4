          <h2>What is was back then?</h2>
          <p> Back then women were not treated good at all. Women’s suffrage (or franchise) is the right of women to vote in political elections; campaigns for this right generally included demand for the right to run for public office. The women’s suffrage movement was a decades-long struggle to address fundamental issues of equity and justice. Women in Canada, particularly Asian and Indigenous women, met strong resistance as they struggled for basic human rights, including suffrage.

          <h2>how they changed?</h2>
          <p>Immediately after the Civil War, Susan B. Anthony, a strong and outspoken advocate of women's rights, demanded that the Fourteenth Amendment include a guarantee of the vote for women as well as for African-American males. In 1869, Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton founded the National Woman Suffrage Association. Later that year, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and others formed the American Woman Suffrage Association. However, not until the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919 did women throughout the nation gain the right to vote.</p>

          <h2>what it’s like now?</h2>
          <p>The act states that, “all Canadians have the right to equality, equal opportunity, fair treatment, and an environment free of discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, marital status and family status. These include the right to live free from violence and discrimination; to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; to be educated; to own property; to vote; and to earn an equal wage.

        <h2>In the 1880s, women who worked as hired maids had little influence over their pay. Additionally, they had faith that their boss would look out for them and wouldn't do them any harm. However, because of their limitations and what they believed in, their managers frequently ignored these flaws and took advantage of them. These women frequently had to deal with the threat of sexual harassment from their male supervisor and/or other violent men due to their flaws, such as their inability to show reverence for their superiors and their lack of fighting spirit. There were not many opportunities for women to seek advanced education at the time, which contributed to a shortage of competent female employees in the 1880s. Most of the women worked in factories, farms, or as domestic help. Married women, on the other hand, looked after their children and supported their spouses. Another negative for women to work back then was that their pay was much less compared to men but there could be reasons to why this might be like emotional needs social needs overall focus or even paternity leaves could all be factors to why men get paid more than women.
